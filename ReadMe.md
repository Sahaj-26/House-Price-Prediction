## California House Price Prediction Model

The problem that we are going to solve here is that given a set of features that describe a house in California, our machine learning model must predict the house price. To train our machine learning model with boston housing data, we will be using scikit-learnâ€™s fetch_california_housing dataset.

In this dataset, each row describes a california town or suburb. There are 20640 rows and 8 attributes (features) with a target column (price). https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/housing.names
